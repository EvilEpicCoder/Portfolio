## Portfolio Project
### freeCodeCamp practical task no2

#### History
I've have created few portfolios, this is number 3 portfolio.
First one was on clear CSS and HTML luck of cross browser/mobile compability.
Second on Bootstrap framework completely removed and separated to a special project.
Third one I've found very interesting Materialize framework.

#### Objectives
1. Create scroling page.
2. Create portfolio like.
3. Made some special effect
4. Try new framework, find out something new for myself

#### Plusses of my project
1. Used MaterializeCSS because it light, cool and still new.
2. Used MaterializeCSS "pushpin" effect, then menu push another menu.
3. Good mobile support.
   
#### Minuses of my project
1. Still Beta
2. Not implemented my features, cause I lazy.
3. Too much HTML, more likely looks like I am not JavaScript programmer.
On my opinion can be made some tricks, so code can be redused 4-5 times, with heavy use of JavaScript
4. Probably good Idea to work in direction of my own framework, and not delete previous project.

#### My suggestion
There is no big difference between Bootsrap and Materialize, some parts little easyly on one framework other parts on another. There is no big difference in visual interface, buttons, carosels, menus, text fields etc.
Unfortunately or luckely there is big reason to create your own style and your own framework. I though it useless, but now I see, ther is big reason to mave somethig you own special, and styled as you like.
It amazing to have framefork as Materialize, than you can just for few hours create amazing things, but it still remain "partly dead", like something missing. So every project require a lot of time to put the "soul" into your page.
